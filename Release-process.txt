= Release Process

Make all changes for the milestone. Make sure all tests needed are written and passing.

Update the build number in:

	pom.xml mkinstaller install-aux/winget-manifest.yaml

Run mkinstaller on Linux (twice), on macOS and on Windoze.

Pick a silly name for the release.

Create the release on GitHub, uploading all the binaries.

Update the version in our entry in winget, push, send pull request.

Update the 'ver' variable in the README, make the doc locally,
test all the download links, then push to GitHub.
