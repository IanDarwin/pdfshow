= Release Process

Make all changes for the milestone. Make sure all tests needed are written and passing.

Update the build number, and commit and push, in:

	pom.xml mkinstaller README.adoc install-aux/winget-manifest.yaml

Run mkinstaller on Linux (twice), on macOS and on Windoze.

Pick a silly name for the release.

Create the release on GitHub, uploading all the binaries.

Update the version in our entry in winget, push, send pull request.
