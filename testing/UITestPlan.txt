= UI Test Plan for PdfShow

Please run all tests in order. Many of them depend on earlier actions.
While running these tests, keep the console open so that you can see
if any stack traces are issued.
Ignore any debug outputs.
In some IDEs, stack traces and errors are in red while debug outputs are in black.

== Notifications (a.k.a. non-empty main pane)

== Find/Search

You can invoke "find" from the Edit->Find menu (shortcut CTRL/F), or type typing the search string
in the search box near the middle of the left-hand toolbox.

Open the sample file provided. Use the Find menu to look for "point".
It should take you to the last page ("graph to prove a point.").
Verify that the down arrow in the toolbox is disabled, and the up arrow is enabled.

Use CTRL/F to open the find dialog. Verify that the text gives an
initial value of "point". Change the text to "fox" and press OK.
Verify that you are taken to page 1, and that the up arrow is
disabled and the down arrow enable. This verifies that the find
feature wraps around from the bottom of the file to the top correctly.

One more find, for "mov". Verify that you're on page 3 with the "moving
along" arrow graphic, and that both up and down arrows are enabled.

(This paragraph is a placeholder for when search has forward/reverse functionality).
