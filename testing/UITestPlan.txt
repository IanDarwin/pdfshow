= UI Test Plan for PdfShow

Please run all tests in order. Many of them depend on earlier actions.
While running these tests, keep the console open so that you can see
if any stack traces are issued.
Ignore any debug outputs.
In Eclipse, stack traces and errors are in red while debug outputs are in black.

== Open/Close/Recent

* Run the program with no arguments.
* In the File menu, clear the Recents menu.
* Open the file samples/SampleShow.pdf
* Verify that page number starts at 1.
* Verify that there are 5 pages and that you can move to all of them.
* Close the application
* Run the program again
* Ensure that SampleShow.pdf is the only entry in the Recents menu.
* Open this file by selecting its menu item.

== Drawing

* On page 1 of the document, click the T (text) box in the Toolbox,
then click somewhere on the page, and enter the string "Hello World."
* Verify that it appears in red monospaced font.
* Select the Font button at the bottom of the Toolbox.
* Select some distinctive font (depends on what fonts you have installed). Click Apply.
* Select the Color button.
* Pick a dark color such as blue or green. Click Apply.
* Click the T again, click somewhere on the page, and enter the string "Colored and Styled."
* Ensure that the string appears in the font and color you selected.
* Ensure that the original text "Hello world" still appears in the default font and color.

== Adding (and deleting) pages

* Still on page 1, select Add Page from the Edit menu.
* Ensure that you see a blank page with no annotations, and that it is numbered 2.
* Use the Up button to go back to page 1. Ensure that the strings and lines still appear
in the correct styling.
* Use the Down button to go to page 2 (should be blank), then Page 3 (should have no annoations).
* Ensure that each page has the correct page numbering.

== Navigation

* Still on page 3, click the "<<" button, and ensure you wind up on Page 1.
* Click the page number text field, type "3", and press Enter.
* Ensure you are on the third page. The number shall be 3; 4 is too many, and 5 is right out.
* Click the ">>" button, and ensure you wind up on the last page
(as of today you will wind up on the 2nd last page - known issue).
