== ToDo (Note: Moving from this to using GH issues; please do not add new items here).

GUI:
	SHRINK ICONS - make all 48x48

SELECT MODE:
	Delete selected with delete key or menu (needs change from GObject[] to List<GObject>)
	Bonus: Select TEXT from the PDF for copy-n-paste

Drawing:
	Replace the "replace and repaint" rubberbanding with DrawingMode.XOR
		Because it's way too slow (esp. polyline) on some platforms.
	Implement proper undo stack (then addIn would push a Delete cmd)
	Properties: at least Font chooser, Color Chooser, LineWidth
	Lines should be able to have arrowheads.

Show micro-preview of next page below the toolbox

Longer Range Goals:
	Save annotations with the PDF (either in it or beside it)
	List chapters, bookmarks
	User-creatable Bookmarks? (editable text)

"Maybe" ideas:
	Ability to auto-transition back-and-forth between a chosen slide in each of two presos
	Index tab (first line and page#)
	A back button for when you scroll past a bunch of pages (Stack of page#s)
