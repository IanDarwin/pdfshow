== ToDo

Buglets:
	Items jump around a bit when adding other objects (Text?)
	Return key should advance, DEL should go back, up/down arrows, etc
	Page number should be one-origin in Sidebar.

Drawing:
	GObjects should get BoundingBox for hit detection.
	Delete indiv objects, undo stack (then addIn would push a Delete cmd)
	Properties: at least Font chooser, Color Chooser, LineWidth

UI
	Scale the PDF to fit width (keeping it full screen?)
	Icon buttons instead of text buttons
	A back button for when you scroll past a bunch of pages (Stack of page#s)
	File opened from argv should be added to recents menu.

Longer Range Goals:
	Save annotations with the PDF (either in it or beside it)
	User-creatable Bookmarks? (editable text)
	Index tab (first line and page#)

Weird ideas:
	Ability to auto-transition back-and-forth between a chosen slide in each of two presos
