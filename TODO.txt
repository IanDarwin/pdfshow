== ToDo (Note: Moving from this to using GH issues; please do not add new items here).

Show micro-preview of next page below the toolbox

Longer Range Goals:
	Save annotations with the PDF (either in it or beside it)
	List chapters, bookmarks
	User-creatable Bookmarks? (editable text)

"Maybe" ideas:
	Ability to auto-transition back-and-forth between a chosen slide in each of two presos
	Index tab (first line and page#)
	A back button for when you scroll past a bunch of pages (Stack of page#s)
