== ToDo

Buglets:
	Items jump around a bit when adding other objects (Text?)
	Page number should be one-origin in Sidebar.

Drawing:
	GObjects should draw as they are created (mouse drag)
	GObjects should get BoundingBox for hit detection.
	Be able to edit at least the text of text objects.
	Be able to delete indiv objects, undo stack (then addIn would push a Delete cmd)
	Properties: at least Font chooser, Color Chooser, LineWidth

UI
	Scale the PDF to fit width (keeping it full screen?)
	A back button for when you scroll past a bunch of pages (Stack of page#s)
	File opened from argv should be added to recents menu.
	Better, more unified, and larger, icons in toolbox.

Longer Range Goals:
	Save annotations with the PDF (either in it or beside it)
	User-creatable Bookmarks? (editable text)
	Index tab (first line and page#)

Weird ideas:
	Ability to auto-transition back-and-forth between a chosen slide in each of two presos
