== ToDo

Buglets:
	jump to page #, thinks on page 1 when on page n
	Return key should advance, DEL should go back

Major:
	Add text and line annotation code

UI
	Scaleable layout, full-screen.
	Better layout of toolbox.
	Key listener so down/up arrows work

Ability to auto-transition back-and-forth between a chosen slide in each of two presos

Bookmarks (editable text)

Longer:
	Drawing tools: text, polyline

Weird ideas:
	A back button for when you scroll past a bunch of pages (Stack of page#s)
