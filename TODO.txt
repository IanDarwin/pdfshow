== ToDo

Buglets:
	Page number is reset when scrolling
	Items jump up about 50px when adding Text - Happens on macOS, ObSD, but NOT MS-Win

SELECT Mode:
	Select objects
	Select TEXT from the PDF for copy-n-paste

Drawing:
	GObjects should get BoundingBox for hit detection.
	Be able to edit at least the text of text objects.
	Implement proper undo stack (then addIn would push a Delete cmd)
	Properties: at least Font chooser, Color Chooser, LineWidth
	Lines should have arrowheads.

UI
	App icon.
	A back button for when you scroll past a bunch of pages (Stack of page#s)
	File opened from argv should be added to recents menu.
	Better, more unified, and larger, icons in toolbox.

Longer Range Goals:
	Save annotations with the PDF (either in it or beside it)
	User-creatable Bookmarks? (editable text)

"Maybe" ideas:
	Ability to auto-transition back-and-forth between a chosen slide in each of two presos
	Index tab (first line and page#)

Good Tasks for New Contributors (in addition to many of the above):
	Easy: Change the resizing calculation from scale-both-axes to maxpect
	Medium: Replace the "replace and repaint" rubberbanding with DrawingMode.XOR
		Because it's way too slow (esp. polyline) on some platforms.
	Hard: Make it perfect :-)
