== ToDo

Buglets:
	Return key should advance, DEL should go back, up/down arrows, etc
	Page number should be one-origin in Sidebar.

Drawing:
	GObjects should get BoundingBox for hit detection.
	Delete objects, undo stack (then addIn would of course push a Delete cmd)

UI
	Scaleable layout, full-screen.
	Icon buttons instead of text buttons
	A back button for when you scroll past a bunch of pages (Stack of page#s)

Longer Range Goals:
	Bookmarks? (editable text)
	Index tab (first line and page#)

Weird ideas:
	Ability to auto-transition back-and-forth between a chosen slide in each of two presos
