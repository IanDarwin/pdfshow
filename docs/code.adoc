= pdfshow code guide

== Components

There are three main files:

* PDFShow.java is the main program, and implements a State Machine pattern; there is a State for each of the buttons
in the toolbox.
* DocTab is the Document Tab; there is one for each open file.
* GObject.java is the graphics objects. They are POJO objects, not Swing JComponents.

== Code Style

We use the Sun coding standard merged with the One True Brace Style. See the existing code for examples.
