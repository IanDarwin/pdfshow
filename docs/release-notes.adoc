= Release Notes

The release notes for current and past releases are in the github under releases.

== Version 1.0.4, 2023-05

v1.0.4 "Double Header" is the first release supporting two monitors, as conventional slide show programs do.
The "control" screen has the control buttons and the "view" screen goes full-screen on the second monitor.
This is beta and has not been extensively tested, so comments would be welcome!

Of course it still works on a single monitor.

I suspect the #1 feature request will be the ability to choose which monitor to have which screen on.
My first idea is to just open the control screen on whichever screen you start the program on,
and the view screen on the other. Other ideas?
