= Making A Release

* Make all changes for the milestone. Make sure all tests needed are written and passing.
Test the **** out of it!
* Pick a sillyName (cutesly release name) for the release.
* Bump the build number and sillyName, and commit and push, in:
** ver in FOUR FILES pom.xml mkinstaller README.adoc (which also needs sillyName)
* Check latest year date in aboutButton actionlistener in src/main/java/net/rejmi/pdfshow/SwingGUI.java
* Commit them all.
* git tag -a -m 'Version x.y.z' vx.y.z
* git push --tag
* For each supported platform:
** sh mkinstaller
* Create the release on GitHub, and upload binaries:
*** Signon if needed
*** On first machine:
**** Under Releases at right, Create New Release (first) 
**** Set tag to same as vx.y.z used in tag (from dropdown)
**** Install the sillyname
**** Write a bit ("release notes") about this release
**** Drag the `with-dependencies- jar from one machine.
**** Wait for that to upload. Then upload your newly-minted installer.
*** On subsequent machines:
**** Under Releases, Update Release (subsequent)
*** Drag the just-created installer into the drag area
*** Click Create or Update Release

For Winget:

After making the MSI installer:

* Update the files in install-winget (versions, dates, etc)
* `cd ~/git-others/winget-pkgs`
* If that doesn't exist, `cd ~/git-others; git clone https://github.com/microsoft/winget-pkgs`
* `git pull`
* `git pull upstream master`
** If no upstream, do `git remote add upstream https://github.com/microsoft/winget-pkgs`
** May take a LONG time
** Do a git push
* `mkdir manifests/r/RejminetGroupInc/PDFShow/$VER`
* Update the sha hash in install-winget/
* `cp -r ~/git/pdfshow/install-winget/*.yaml manifests/r/RejminetGroupInc/PDFShow/$VER`
* git commit
* git push
* Send pull request on gh:
** open https://github.com/microsoft/winget-pkgs
** Click Pull Request in top bar.
** Click green New Pull Request button
** Click link "compare across forks"
** On right side, click Compare dropdown, select IanDarwin/winget-pkgs
** Enter title, brief description.
** Click Create New Pull Request.
** Watch the Conversation.
** If the whole thing fails after a few minutes, fix the problem and try again.
** If "All checks have passed" after a few mins, the next delay requires human action, so be patient.
