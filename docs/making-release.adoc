= Making A Release

* Make all changes for the milestone. Make sure all tests needed are written and passing.
Test the **** out of it!
* Pick a sillyName (cutesly release name) for the release.
* Bump the build number and sillyName, and commit and push, in:

** ver: pom.xml mkinstaller install-aux/winget-manifest.yaml
** ver and sillyName: README.adoc 

* Bump the version number both in pom.xml AND in mkinstaller
* Commit both.
* git tag -a -m 'Version x.y.z' vx.y.z
* git push --tag
* For each supported platform:
** sh mkinstaller
* Upload the binaries to github:
*** Signon if needed
*** On first machine:
**** Under Releases at right, Create New Release (first) 
**** Set tag to same as vx.y.z used in tag (from dropdown)
**** Install the sillyname
**** Write a bit about this release
**** Drag the `with-dependencies- jar from one machine.
**** Wait for that to upload. Then upload your newly-minted installer.
*** On subsequent machines:
**** Under Releases, Update Release (subsequent)
*** Drag the just-created installer into the drag area
*** Click Create or Update Release

Note that the WinGet (windows CLI installer) support is not working;
`jpackage` seems to have some incompatibility.
Update the version in our entry in winget, push, send pull request.
XXX Do we need to update InstallerSha256 manually?
