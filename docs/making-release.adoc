= Making A Release

* Test the **** out of it!
* Bump the version number both in pom.xml AND in mkinstaller
* Commit both.
* git tag -a -m 'Version x.y.z' vx.y.z
* git push --tag
* For each supported platform:
** sh mkinstaller
** Upload the binaries to github:
*** Signon if needed
*** On first machine:
**** Under Releases at right, Create New Release (first) 
**** Set tag to same as vx.y.z used in tag (from dropdown)
**** Pick a cutesy release name.
**** Write a bit about this release
**** Drag the `with-dependencies- jar from one machine.
**** Wait for that to upload. Then upload your newly-minted installer.
*** On subsequent machines:
**** Under Releases, Update Release (subsequent)
*** Drag the just-created installer into the drag area
*** Click Create or Update Release

Note that the WinGet (windows CLI installer) support is not working;
`jpackage` seems to have some incompatibility.
