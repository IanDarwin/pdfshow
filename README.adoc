= PdfShow

Sometimes you have to present a talk and you only have the PDF of the slides,
not the ODP or PPT files. In that case, `PdfShow` is for you.
`PdfShow` is a Java Swing-based PDF viewer specifically for running slide shows.
I wrote it because I have to teach from PDFs and was tired of general-purpose programs 
like PDF Annotator and Adobe Reader, which have too many modes,
controls, etc. and aren't really optimized for showing slide decks.

`PdfShow` has limitations compared with other tools (see the
https://github.com/IanDarwin/pdfshow/issues[TODO list]), due to
its relative youth and, more importantly, its design goals.

Some bells and whistles will be added as time permits, but let's keep it relatively simple.

Pull requests will be gratefully accepted as long as they fit
within the general tone of the program - _minimalist, but functional._

== Installing PdfShow

There may be an installer for your computing platform; see
https://github.com/IanDarwin/pdfshow/releases. Check the latest
release under the _Assets_ dropdown.

Note that the installers bundle their own Java VM, with which they are known
to work; they are about 50Mb to download and about 120-140Mb when installed.
If you use the source or Jar approach, you have to be sure
you have a JDK that will work with `PdfShow`.

If there's no installer, or you'd rather build from source, see <<building>> below.

== Using PdfShow

The program is intuitive and easy to use. Of course they all say that.
Just run it and use `File->Open` (or `CTRL/CMD O`), or run it with a filename argument.
There's a "recent files" menu for subsequent days of your course, for example.
There is more documentation in the `docs` folder.

== Build PdfShow From Source

=== Getting Source

Download the repository from https://github.com/IanDarwin/pdfshow.

Using command-line tools:

	git clone https://github.com/IanDarwin/pdfshow
	cd pdfshow

Using Eclipse:

	Window->Show View->Git->Git Repositories.
	In the Repos window, Clone (the third icon at the right side of this window).
	Enter the URL https://github.com/IanDarwin/pdfshow and click Next
	On the next dialog, be sure to check Import Existing Projects before Next.
	PdfShow should show up in the Package Explorer

=== Prerequisites

You need to have Java 11+ and Maven installed.
You need Java 14+ if you want to build any of the full platform-specific installers.

=== Test Runs

To test run the program in Eclipse, you can just open
and run `PdfShow.java`, the main-program file.
If you use IntelliJ, NetBeans, or some other IDE, you can import and run it.
You can even submit a pull request with that IDE's config files, as long as
it doesn't require changing the directory structure.

To run the program in Maven, use `mvn integration-test`.
I chose that since Maven doesn't offer a "run" phase, and I didn't want to pollute
the "test" phase with interactivity.

=== Packaging

To package just the program and its images (without the dependencies),
do `mvn package`.

To make a clickable runnable JAR file, run `mvn package assembly:single`.
You'll then find a `jar` with dependencies in the target folder.
It'll be named something like `pdfshow-x.y.z-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar`.
You can run it with `java -jar target/pdfshow*dependencies.jar` (see `scripts/pdfshow`), or just click on it in an file
manager window in MS-Windows, macOS, or most *Nix windowed environments.

To make a full-blown, platform-specific installer, we use the `mkinstaller` script.
You can run that yourself if you need to.
Note that on Windows `jpackager` has a couple of pre-requisites, which it will let you know about if they're not already installed.

The install formats are:

.The Installer Formats
[options="header",cols="2,4,3"]
|====
|OS|Current Format|Other formats with `mkinstaller -t`
|macOS|DMG, with copy-to-Applications iconage.|pkg
|Linux|rpm - Redhat/Yum/dnf/Zypher|deb
|Windows|MSI installer|exe
|====

== Development

Fork the repo, clone your forked copy, make changes, test changes, send a pull request.

Q: Why didn't I use this for the drawing:

	PDPageContentStream contentStream = new PDPageContentStream(document, page);
	contentStream.setNonStrokingColor(Color.DARK_GRAY);
	contentStream.addRect(200, 650, 100, 100);

A: The problem is that it would be much harder (if not impossible) to implement Undo processing
when using that approach. Perhaps a later Save PDF function could
insert the GObjects into the PDF using this technique.

Q: Why not use the built-in `contains()` method for hit detection?

A: The `GObject` hierarchy is intentionally light-weight, not JComponent, and
it's gotta be the same amount of work.
