= PdfShow

PdfShow is a simple Swing-based PDF viewer for running slide shows.

Pdf access (i.e., the heavy listing!) is via https://pdfbox.apache.org/[Apache PDFBox].

I will add more bells and whistles as time permits.

Pull requests will be gratefully accepted as long as they fit within the general tone of the program - _minimalist, but functional._ 

== How-to

To test run it, just open the project in Eclipse (or import into IntelliJ or
other IDE) and run the PdfShow file.

To make a clickable runnable JAR file, run "mvn package assembly:single"
and you'll find a jar with dependencies in the target folder.
It'll be named something like _pdfshow-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar_
You can run it with `java -jar` or click on it in Windows, Mac, or most *Nix windowed environments.
