= PdfShow

PdfShow is a simple Swing-based PDF viewer for running slide shows.

Pdf access (i.e., the heavy listing!) is via https://pdfbox.apache.org/[Apache PDFBox].

I will add bells and whistles as time permits.

== ToDo

UI
	Scaleable layout, full-screen.
	Better layout of toolbox.
	Key listener so down/up arrows work

Ability to auto-back-and-forth between a chosen slide in each of two presos

Longer:
	Drawing tools: text, polyline
