= PdfShow

`PdfShow` is a PDF viewer specifically for running slide shows.
I wrote it because I do sometimes teach from PDFs and was tired of general-purpose programs 
like PDF Annotator and Adobe Reader, which have too many modes,
controls, etc. and aren't really optimized for showing slide decks.

Wait! Who presents from PDFs?
Maybe you have to present a talk and you only have the PDF, not the ODP, KeyNote or PPT file(s).
Some training companies just distribute their courses to instructors as PDFs, 
not presentation-software files.
Or maybe you want to re-give somebody else's preso from the PDF-only version they published online
(if you do this, make sure to ask permission, give credit, and respect copyrights/licenses).
Or yet again, maybe you use the open-source
https://staff.fnwi.uva.nl/b.diertens/useful/gpresent/[gpresent],
which doesn't run shows but generates the PDF and leaves it to others to display.
Or the Markdown-based https://marp.app/[MARP], which can generate PDFs directly.
Or the MagicPoint-based https://mg.pov.lt/mgp2pdf/[MagicPoint to PDF Converter].
Whatever the reason you need to present with just the PDF of the slides,
`PdfShow` is for you!

`PdfShow` has limitations compared with other tools, due to
its relative youth and, more importantly, its design goals.
_Please_ see the https://github.com/IanDarwin/pdfshow/issues[list of issues];
read through it before condemning the app as incomplete and again before
adding to it - anyone can create a free github account and add issues there!
That is also why there's no TODO file here - all the TODOs are in the issues list.

The program is for desktops, not mobiles. There is too much dependency on Swing
to make it feasible to run on platforms other than desktop Java.

More bells and whistles will be added as time permits, but let's keep it relatively simple.
There is still some basic functionality that is imperfect or incomplete.
Pull requests will be gratefully accepted as long as they fit
within the general tone of the program - _minimalist, but functional._

== Installing PdfShow

There may be an installer for your desktop computing platform; see
https://github.com/IanDarwin/pdfshow/releases. Check the latest
release under the _Assets_ dropdown.

These installers bundle their own Java VM, with which they are known
to work; they are about 50Mb to download and about 120-140Mb when installed.
If you already have a current Java installed, you may prefer to run the JAR file.
When using the source or JAR approach, you have to be sure
you have a JDK that will work with `PdfShow`.
The jar is built with Java {current-release} on most platforms.

For MS-Windows 10 or 11,  I'm only building for 64-bit AMD/Intel systems
as that's the vast majority; others can run the jar file or build it themselves.
For those with x64 systems, you can either manually download the MSI installer, or simplify with winget.
Winget is MS' relatively-new package installer - they're finally catching up with every other desktop OS on the planet :-)
Anyway, if you don't have winget but do have "Microsoft Store", you can get winget from there (I think it's part of "Microsoft Installer"). 
This will enable easier installation on Windows, without affecting the other environments.

Once the paperwork is done (what do we call that when it's all online click-wrap stuff?), you'll be able to just type:

	winget install RejminetGroupInc.PDFShow

Rejminet Group is my consulting company.

If there's no installer, and you have Java, there's a Jar file that you can run with `java -jar`.
You can rebuild that from source with `mvn package assembly:single`; see <<building>> below.

== Using PdfShow

The program is intuitive and easy to use. Of course they all say that.
Just run it and use `File->Open` (or `CTRL/CMD O`), or run it with a filename argument.
There's a "recent files" menu for subsequent days of your course, for example.
There is more documentation in the `docs` folder.

[[building]]
== Build PdfShow From Source

=== Prerequisites

You need to have Java 11+ and Maven installed.
You need Java 14+ if you want to build any of the full platform-specific installers.
The installers and the public Jar file are built with {current-release}.

=== Getting Source

Download the repository from https://github.com/IanDarwin/pdfshow.

Install Apache-Maven if not already installed.

Using command-line tools:

	git clone https://github.com/IanDarwin/pdfshow
	cd pdfshow

Using Eclipse:

	Window->Show View->Git->Git Repositories.
	In the Repos window, Clone (the third icon at the right side of this window).
	Enter the URL https://github.com/IanDarwin/pdfshow and click Next
	On the next dialog, be sure to check Import Existing Projects before Next.
	PdfShow should show up in the Package Explorer
	
Using IntelliJ IDEA

	From the startup screen, "Get from Version Control"
	Enter the URL https://github.com/IanDarwin/pdfshow and click Clone
	Accept or choose the directory and click Clone
	On "Open or Import" popup (with choice of how to open), select "Maven Project"

=== Test Runs

To test run the program in a supported Java IDE (Eclipse and IntelliJ IDEa),
you just open and run `PdfShow.java`, the main-program file.
If you use another IDE, the same goes.
You can even submit a pull request with that IDE's config files, __as long as
it doesn't require changing the directory structure__ (i.e., moving existing files around).

To run the program in Maven, use `mvn integration-test`.
I chose that since Maven doesn't offer a "run" phase, and I didn't want to pollute
the "test" phase with interactivity.

=== Packaging

To make a JAR file with just the program and its images (without the dependencies), do `mvn package`.

To make a clickable runnable JAR file, run `mvn package assembly:single`.
You'll then find a `jar` with dependencies in the target folder.
It'll be named something like `target/pdfshow-x.y.z-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar`.
You can run it with `java -jar target/pdfshow*dependencies.jar` (see `scripts/pdfshow`), or just click on it in a file
manager window in MS-Windows, macOS, or most *Nix windowed environments.

The full-blown, platform-specific installers we release are built by the `mkinstaller` script. 
This makes a clickable runnable JAR file as above
and then runs the Java 14+ 
https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/14/docs/specs/man/jpackage.html[jpackage] tool.
You can run that script yourself if you want.
You can only build the Mac installer on macOS, the Windows installer on Windows, etc.

=== Configuring a Linux rpm-based system to build pdfshow

This may not be optimal, but should to work. Newer versions may be available.

----
sudo dnf install https://cdn.azul.com/zulu/bin/zulu17.32.13-ca-jdk17.0.2-linux.x86_64.rpm

sudo dnf install rpm-build

# These systems' packaging have Maven depending on dark ages' JDK-1.8, so:

curl -o apache-maven-3.8.4-bin.tar.gz \
	https://dlcdn.apache.org/maven/maven-3/3.8.4/binaries/apache-maven-3.8.4-bin.tar.gz

cd /usr/local; sudo tar xzvf apache-maven-3.8.4.tar.gz

PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/apache-maven-3.8.4/bin

mkdir git
cd git
git clone https://github.com/IanDarwin/pdfshow

cd pdfshow

mkinstaller -s # skiptests; they fail on this Linux with infra-related errs, don't care
----

==== Pre-requisites

On all platforms you need JDK and Apache Maven installed.
On Windows `jpackage` has a couple of pre-requisites,
which it will let you know about if they're not already installed.

On Linux, for RPMs, you need `rpm-build` or you will get told that 'rpm' is an invalid type
(sudo dnf install rpm-build).
On Linux, for DEBs, you may need `fakeroot` (sudo apt install fakeroot).

The install formats are:

[[table-name]]
.The Installer Formats
[options="header",cols="2,4,3"]
|====
|OS|Default Format|Other formats with `mkinstaller -t`
|macOS|DMG, with copy-to-Applications iconage.|pkg
|Linux|rpm - Redhat/Yum/dnf/Zypher|deb
|Windows|MSI installer|exe
|====

== Development

Fork the repo, clone your forked copy, make changes, test changes, send a pull request.

Q: Why didn't I use this for the drawing:

	PDPageContentStream contentStream = new PDPageContentStream(document, page);
	contentStream.setNonStrokingColor(Color.DARK_GRAY);
	contentStream.addRect(200, 650, 100, 100);

A: The problem is that it would be much harder (if not impossible) to implement Undo processing
when using that approach. Perhaps a later Save PDF function could
insert the GObjects into the PDF using this technique.

Q: Why not use the built-in `contains()` method for hit detection?

A: The `GObject` hierarchy is intentionally light-weight, not JComponent, and
it's gotta be the same amount of work.
