= PdfShow

PdfShow is a simple Swing-based PDF viewer for running slide shows.

Pdf access (i.e., the heavy listing!) is via https://pdfbox.apache.org/[Apache PDFBox].

I will add bells and whistles as time permits.

== ToDo

Obvious:
	Menus, at least Open, Close
	Key listener so down/up arrows work

Tabs for multiple decks open at a time
	Then: Ability to auto-back-and-forth between a chosen slide in each of two presos

UI
	Better layout of toolbox.

Longer:
	Drawing tools: text, polyline
